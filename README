Music: Juho Heikkinen
All other code: Tatu Kilappa

NOTE: The intro is only guaranteed to work in it's pure 4096  byte form in
      FreeBSD 7.2 with nVidia cards. To view the intro as intended on other
      platforms, please compile and run it using Autotools.

NOTE: It seems that the GLSL code won't work on ATi no matter what is done.
      Bugger.
